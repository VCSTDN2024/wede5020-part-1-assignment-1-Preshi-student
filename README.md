Kind root Haven 

Brief history of the organisation 
Kind root Haven was developed in 2018 to cater for children who were left homeless, abused at their own homes, and even who were abandoned.  It began with just one lady who with a kind caring heart would shelter those abandoned kids in her neighbourhood.  She was known as Mama Nandi, a retired teacher who was on pension. 
Seeing this kindness, she moved many people and in just a short period of time some months later, volunteers within her community joined her and started donating food, clothes, and basic needs.  So, like that more people joined with me also coming to be part of the team.  Then in 2019 Kind Root Haven was officially registered as a non-profit organisation whereby we got great support from local schools, churches and even small businesses.  With much growth over time us as Kind Root Haven have supported more than 30 children by providing them shelter, teaching them through creative education programs, and supporting them emotionally by guiding them through our core values of:
Kindness
Dignity 
Growth 
Vision
Our vision as Kind Root Haven is to nurture resilient, and compassionate children to grow into empowered adults that then get ready to shape their communities with kindness, courage, and purpose. 
Mission
Our mission is to provide a safe, nurtured environment where orphans and vulnerable children will receive special childcare, emotional support and even have access to education.  This will empower these children to heal, grow and even thrive within a loving community.

Partners and Sponsors Page
 

The Partners and Sponsors page will highlight the individuals, organisations, and community groups that support Kindroot Haven’s mission. It will therefore feature a heroic banner with an inspiring message and a headline with a brief message that outlines the power of collaboration.  It will showcase the different partner logos, which are accompanied by short testimonials or even linked websites that will build trust and recognition. 
This page will have important highlights that showcase what these have helped us achieve such as donated meals, school supplies, and volunteer hours.  Sponsors will be grouped by category such as corporate, community, and foundations to ensure that there is clarity and appreciation. 
On this page you will also see the “Become a partner” section which invites new sponsors to join the mission, which offers a downloadable sponsorship kit or even a direct contact form. 
Testimonials Page
“Every leaf tells a story. This is theirs.”  This page will showcase real experiences from clients, visitors, and supporters who have gotten in touch and connected with Kindroot Haven.  
Whereby you will find a testimonials page which is titled, “Stories of Growth” builds an emotional trust by showcasing their stories, real voices that brings an inviting call-to-action that encourages visitors to share their own journey. Along with this the page will still showcase testimonials but even better instead of just using words how better it is to connect with people through visuals that’s when it feels more real.  So, on this page, there will be a soft-scrolling gallery which contains short clips specifically made for people who prefer watching videos rather than watching.  
Were now put in different cards with each of their own message regarding KindRoot Haven.

Design and User Experience

 

This website will use a gentle and ground design aesthetic that mirrors our organisation’s values of care, healing, and growth. The colour will include more of nature’s colours such as a soft green, warm beige, and natural brown to evoke warmth and safety.  Typography is also a very important feature that ensures very interesting to provide captivating fonts for headers, which are paired with a clean sans-serif for body text to ensure legibility and emotional resonance.  The layout will follow a simple, intuitive structure that features clear navigation bars, responsive section blocks, and being able to access the mobile design in order to ensure the ease of use across all devices.  

Technical Requirements
The website will be built using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the structure.  WordPress or Web flow can be considered for easier
content updates.  Hosting will be secured through a provider that is reliable, whereby the domain name that will reflect our organisation’s identity.  

Timeline and Milestones
•	The project will be completed in four weeks. 
•	In the first week, we will focus on branding and the layout design. 
•	In the second week, we will start building the homepage and the core pages. 
•	In week 3, we will dedicate our time to adding content and refining the user experience.

Budget
Category	Description	Estimated Cost (Rand)
Domain and Hosting 	This is the domain name and hosting for an accessible online space. 	R350-R850 per year
Design & Branding 	This is our custom logo, colour palette, and our size layout that evokes warmth and belonging. 	R500-R2000(for once-off)
SEO & Accessibility	This is for optimising search engines and ensures for all visitors included. 	R0-R1000(one-time fee)
Maintenance & Updates	This is for ongoing support, bug fixes, and content updates.	R0-R1000


Then for part 3 we had to add SEO such as meta tags to help search engines understand our website and so that it becomes more discoverable.  We had to add animations to make the website more interesting for the user, 
er to interact with it more. 
We also had to add javascript for the functionality so that all the buttons function, the toast messages, and also forms I also added a live map to my contacts page.  

Feature 1:  Meta tags for discoverability 
Feature 2:  Added animations so website is interesting 
Feature 3: Forms to fill in details for customer and the donations form if one will like to donate. 




Challenges: 
Challenge 1:  I struggled to put some animations whereby when I incorporated it wasn't working the way I wanted it to. 
Solution:  I had to watch a youtube video to figure that out. 

Challenge 2:  I struggled to incorporate the video probably on the donations page 
Solution:   There was something wrong of how I placed it and I fixed it so it doesn't cover up the whole page but instead goes below.
