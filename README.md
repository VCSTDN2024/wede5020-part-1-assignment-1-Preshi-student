Web Development Assignment 2 
Precious Mbabazi 

##Project Overview
Kind Root Haven is a non-profit organisation that was created as part of the assignment of Web development to develop our own website.  This website was made using the 3 coding languages which are html which is more of a script 
language, CSS which was used to style and design, and then finally Javascript which will be used in part 3 to add functionality.   This website was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment whereby the assignment 
had to be responsive, have multiple pages, and run on multiple browsers such as google, firefox, microsoft edge etc.

##Purpose and Features 

The main goal was to ensure that the website was integrated with CSS and that it was responsive on multiple devices using a mixture of relative values, media queries, and breakpoints.
